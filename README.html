<p>The public website is no longer distributed with every build. Sorry!<a href = "files/projectexist"></a></p>
<p>To advance through the game, <tt>left-click</tt> or press the <tt>space</tt> or <tt>enter</tt> keys. When at a menu, <tt>left-click</tt> to make a choice, or use the arrow keys to select a choice and <tt>enter</tt> to select it.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=renpy/Help&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Game Menu">edit</a>]</span>Time of Day, FP, SP, and other crap</h3>
<p>For the most part, these, and any other acronyms you need are in the Glossary. Especially check the Battle System section. However, some of the earlier/more important acronyms are also below:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Time of Day</dt>
  <dd>As you do certain actions, time will pass. Each non-weekend day generally proceeds as follows:</dd>
  <dd>Wake-up--&gt;Breakfast--&gt;School--&gt;Lunch--&gt;School--&gt;Other Activities--&gt;Choose bed-time--&gt;Sleep<br>
    Weekend
  days cut-out School and School-type events. Keeping track of the Time of Day is extremely important. Some events can only happen at certain Time of Days. In addition, the time you go to sleep at influences how much SP you regain during the night.</dd>
  <dt>FP</dt>
  <dd>FP/Food Points serves as your hunger and in some cases, part of your stamina. Most attacks that require FP generally don't require very much and are much stronger than the average ability. If it ever falls below 0 however, you will die (after the battle ends if you are in one when it happens.) 30 FP a day and 5 FP a battle is deducted.  </dd>
  <dt>SP</dt>
  <dd>SP/Sleep Points serves as your fatigue and in some cases, part of your stamina. Most attacks that require SP generally don't require very much and are much stronger than the average ability. If it ever falls below 0 however, you will die (after the battle ends if you are in one when it happens.) 20 SP a day is deducted; sleeping reduces, reverses, or overcompensates for this.</dd>
</dl>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Game Menu</span></h3> 
<p>When playing a game, <tt>right-click</tt> or press the <tt>escape</tt> key to enter the game menu. The game menu gives the following choices:</p> 
<dl>

<dt>Save Game</dt>
