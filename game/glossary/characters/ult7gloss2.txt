I am looking back at my childhood memories,
And they've faded but I still have: a red and white cap placed on my head.
I AM ULTRAMAN, I AM ULTRAMAN, SEVEN!

And one of the good ones stand out to me - I'm eating!
Mother's curry and something else. So put some silver spoons on my eyes.
I AM ULTRAMAN, I AM ULTRAMAN, SEVEN!

I forgot all those things and I live every day
As if there's something right behind me and I think it's chasing me to Hell!

Even if I look back now, (Iâ€™m looking through an old photo book I just found.)
I still can't go back there. (And I'm doing many dumb things)
Not any more... (While I'm laughing with my good friends)
I AM ULTRAMAN, I AM ULTRAMAN, SEVEN!

I kinda wonder where all of my friends have gone. And did my ex-girl find a good man?
I guess I'll never know but
I AM ULTRAMAN, I AM ULTRAMAN, SEVEN!

I forgot all those things and I live every day
As if there's some thing right behind me and I think it's chasing me to Hell! 

Courage that you have gi-hi-ven to me's Infinity! Infinity! (Yeah~)
Seasons that we all spent together were duramatic...

We are looking back at our childhood memories
And we're using 3-D glasses. They were from an old Shonen Jump.
I AM ULTRAMAN, I AM ULTRAMAN, SEVEN!
