There once was a boy. Then he became a man. As he aged, he realized that he had a problem. He missed being young. The idea, oddly enough, wasn't that he wanted perpetual youth; he was wise enough to understand that living forever would be a cruel form of torture (albeit incredibly useful). He missed being innocent and happy all of the time. One day, he fell into a coma, and never woke up.

In his dreams, he became a superhero. Innocent. Just. Respected. He became the superhero he pretended to be as a child. He became Ultraman 7. But on the inside of the cyborg armor, he was the same old man. Lustful. Greedy. Ashamed. But he had to fight on. Because this was a new world...

Ultraman 7 is based on Omoide wa Okkusenman, a fairly "memetic" song in Japanese pop culture. Based off of Dr. Wily's Stage 1 from Megaman 2, the song is based off of Blue Fang's (Aoi Kiba's) rearrange and PiggKingg's lyrics. The lyrics themselves revolve around the singer remembering his childhood and friends, especially while pretending to be Ultraman and Ultra Seven... and that adult life is nothing like a child's life. But then who is Ultraman 7, really? Not a mix between Ultraman and Ultra Seven, but a new robotic hero entirely.
