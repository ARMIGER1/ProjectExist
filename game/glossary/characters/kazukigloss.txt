You are Kazuki Okamoto, the son of two Japanese working-class parents. As a result of a botched Caesarean section, your mother died of internal bleeding; this left your father in the proverbial dark. In an attempt to escape his own memories, and in hopes of giving the remaining family a better life, he takes you and moves to America. To be precise, San Francisco, California. But as any psychologist knows, a change of scenery cannot coerce a change of the mind...

Fast-forward 18 years. You are attending the local community college, and living in a small apartment. You pay for this apartment using your job at the local machine shop... you also pay for your father's bar tab... and your college tuition... and your living expenses... for all intents and purposes, you are the self-reliant, lonely breadwinner. This job, which you've had for 4 years, is becoming more unstable as the world moves towards mail-ordering and the throwaway mentality. Even through these hardships, you understand that you are fortunate to be able to get by, and maintain a positive outlook on most aspects of life.

As this is going on, you begin to notice that, in the mornings, you've accumulated marks on your body during the night. Marks that you know for certain could not have been caused simply by rolling around in bed. Very early into the game's story, you learn that you are a "Transeescence" (\tran-sÄ“-sen(t)s\): a person whose dreams affect reality. The rest of his story belongs to you.
