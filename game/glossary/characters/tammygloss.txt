If someone was to be tenured as a TA, Tamara would be it. She's been teaching freshman seminars for nearly 11 years. As a sophomore in undergraduate school, she taught a seminar for the extra credits, and loved it. The power, the simplicity, the ease... it all suited her. She switched her intended major from Electrical Engineering to Education that year. When she saw the poor starting salaries and read stories about many layoffs before tenure, she reversed the switch. That aside, she continued to TA throughout undergraduate school and graduate school, and she is now working towards a Ph.D in Computer Engineering. As that pressure came down on her... her weight went up. By a lot. The combination of sedentary lifestyle, stress, and accessible food is rarely safe for the waistline.

Heavy physical problems aside, Tamara was born a Level 5 Transeer, which means she has no Dream Guide. And having no guidance, she may as well be a Level 2. You may decide to be her guide later in the game and gain a powerful ally. Whether her personal issues are worth dealing with is completely your call.
