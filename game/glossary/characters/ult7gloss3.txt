And all of the good ones have just been erased except one.
We pretend to remember-r this one so well: making L-shapes with our forearms.
I AM ULTRAMAN, I AM ULTRAMAN, SEVEN!

I forgot all those things and I live every day
As if there's some thing right be-hee-hind me and I think it's chasing me to Hell!

Even if I look back now, (I cry as I open an old diary; no binding.)
I still can't go back there. (And on the last of the faded pages)
Not any more... (I see the name of my very first love)
I AM ULTRAMAN, I AM ULTRAMAN, SEVEN!

And as a young boy I could simply laugh along! And I could laugh innocently
because back then I said that,
“I AM ULTRAMAN, I AM ULTRAMAN, SEVEN!”

I forgot all those things and I live every day
As if there's some thing right be-hee-hind me and I think it's chasing me to Hell!

As children we slept straight through the sex scenes Infinity! Infinity! (Yeah~)
Seasons that we all spent together were guraffiti...

Courage that you have gi-hi-ven to me's Infinity! Infinity! (yeah)
Seasons that we all spent together were duramatic...
