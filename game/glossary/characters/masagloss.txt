While Kazuki's mythology knowledge completely and totally, for lack of a better word, sucks, his knowledge of Japanese history is on par with professional historians. Swordsmith Masamune (正宗) is included within this knowledge, to the extend that Kazuki can name all of Masamune's students and swords, even to the point that he can do this if given a sketch of the student or sword (for the swords that are in circulation, obviously).

Ironically, selecting the "Unknown Sword" from the Mirror of the Relics will choose Masamune as a dream guide. This is because Kazuki does not recognize the original Kotegiri Masamune. In history, Kotegiri Masamune was shortened by Oda Nobunaga; this shortened sword is what Kazuki would have recognized, but in his dream, again, gaps are filled, and the Kotegiri Masamune appears in its full-length glory.

The Kotegiri Masamune is given many of the properties that the sword would have had it truly been from the legends. It cannot cut the innocent. It heals wounds.

Masamune himself is also an extremely accomplished swordsman, using the style of nitōjutsu (two sword methods) with only one sword, executing the same feints, parries, and thrusts. Masamune can smith a second sword identical to the Kotegiri Masamune, and use true nitōjutsu alongside Kazuki, although Kazuki will never be permitted to use these swords. Once this second sword is made, Masamune can properly use his combat skills.
