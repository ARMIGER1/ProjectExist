If you were to ask Athena, she would tell you that everything you knew about Greek mythology... is wrong. According to her, Olympus itself was, or is, rather, actually underground. This made it easier to stay hidden once early space travel began. Largely speaking, they weren't actually gods so much as humans with abnormal abilities and bravery. After all, anyone can be a hero to the people; heroes just need to act while the public is watching. Athena's apparently long lifespan is explained by having the descendants of any given Greek hero take the name of his/her most prominent parent (this process did not begin until the death of Hercules). Or at least, this is what she believes.

These Greek heroes would surface only when the need for them was evident. For instance, it became evident that the United States needed to establish a national disaster relief system, so Athena trained Clara Barton in preparation for establishing the American Red Cross. It's important to note that Kazuki's knowledge of mythology is nearly non-existent; therefore his brain filled in the gaps for him. As such, this Athena is nothing like the Athena in traditional mythology, and her underground Olympus never actually existed.

Selecting the Aegis from the Mirror of Relics will choose Athena as a dream guide. Athena's main characteristics are greater-than-average strength, cheerful but affirmative personality, excellent swordsmanship, a height of exactly 7 feet, military strategy, and the ability to use shields in highly-offensive manners.
