Lilian Crawford, in polite terms, is slightly more timid than your average person. She also has more childish tendencies, perhaps to the point of failing to act her age. Even if the situation is relatively dire, Lilian will never opt to be in charge, despite her intelligence. Her only true leadership position is at LAST - Language and Science Tutoring. And LAST is so small, perhaps that doesn't count. Kazuki and Wil both have the opportunity to change that, although who gets Lilian-time is left for the player to decide.

Lilian comes from a small, quiet, and unbroken family. Well, physically small. She has four siblings of various ages, although they don't have much importance in Kazuki's story. Getting to know the family may be opening a can of worms, but may also allow Lilian to be more comfortable in this loud world.
