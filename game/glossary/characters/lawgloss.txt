The sarcastic, cynical young (in comparison to the rest of the faculty) man known to Kazuki as "Professor Lawrence" is one of the most accomplished transeers of this time. In addition to having been born as a natural Level 3, he found an early love for physics, which allows him to construct particularly beautiful (and functional) dream worlds. This also allows him to catch and teach a large portion of local transeers (if any) before they leave college.

If correctly interacted with, Lawrence will act as Kazuki's dream guide until Kazuki reaches level 2. Lawrence feels that he is responsible for transeers not because of any particular event in his life, but because he feels that a child with such a difficult burden deserves to have some sort of help. Obviously, Lawrence makes for a very strong ally in terms of both combat and social situations.

Although there are various institutions for transeescence, Lawrence feels that the institutionalization of an ability that relies on objective views of the owner is impossible to conduct properly.
