Hey, want to distract a straight guy? Put Natalie Bellangerd in his field of vision. Job done. He'll be drooling for the next hour or two. And probably won't remember where he was headed. See, every school has to have an idol. For San Francisco Community College, Natalie would probably fit that stereotype. Intelligent. A face for television. Active in the student body. Polite. Outgoing. Athletic. While Natalie was not elected co-captain of the cross country until this year, she has always been able to qualify for sectionals.

Natalie's family has lived in San Francisco for as long as anyone can remember. For all intents and purposes, they are a fairly normal white family, despite the French heritage. Natalie does have an older brother, but he has since moved on to other things. Whether he is important is left for the player to explore.

This blonde, busty senior is one of Kazuki's potential love interests. The three main challenges are going to be the other guys that are after Natalie, the age difference... and Natalie's sexual orientation. She is a self-professed lesbian. Good luck, Kaz. You'll need it. Regardles of whether Kazuki wins Natalie's heart, he'll likely find that the runner is a fairly competent ally.
