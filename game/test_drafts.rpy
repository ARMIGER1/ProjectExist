    nnvlmc "I'm aware of the power within my body. Not because I am innately 
            powerful, but because I have mastered the art of claiming that I 
            have power."
    nnvlmc "This is why I wished that I was not born a human. Our lust for that 
            which we do not have... It's one I could not control. And it is no 
            longer possible to make amends with those that I brought down with 
            me."

    nnvlmc "These once-white hands of mine seized what their master wanted by 
            force, and now they are stained with blood. Nothing will reverse the
            harm that they've done. I have bent this world to my will."
    nnvlmc "The girl that I thought would make me happy. The money that I 
            thought would save my home. The blade that killed my father. All 
            of these I sought to satiate my desires, simply because I could."

    nnvlmc "I lived out those fantasies in my dreams so that they could take 
            place in reality. Not fantasies of domination, but fantasies of... 
            having what I wanted. But that in itself is a display of power."

    nnvlmc "The world cheered as I remove its threats, but I am no savior. I 
            am simply - as I always have - keeping up my appearances. It didn't 
            know what I was doing when it wasn't looking, or why I was helping 
            its inhabitants."
    nnvlmc "I have bent this world to my will, and I have given into my shadow. 
            But he is silent. So whose nightmare is this, really? Mine because 
            of what I have done, or my Dream Guide's because of what she's 
            seen?"
    nnvlmc "Perhaps it doesn't matter. Perhaps all I need to do is wait for my 
            life to end..."
