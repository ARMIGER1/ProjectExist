As my sun sets the night becomes an azure
The stars above, they shine as if they're sure
That the words I sing won't be heard anymore
 
I'd rather trust the words from some random man
Than make the effort to understand
The real reasons why I cry to you now
 
So as I clutch your cold hands here on this park bench 
The sky is dark
But I still see all of your ideals
They were shooting stars
 
Hey! Tell me now
If you will let me live my life this way
 
Because I want to see all of Earth's miracles
And then try to make it through
 
I’m a slave to all of the feelings
That run through my body
And because I have lost
 
I can go on no more
But may I try?
 
I want to make these choices by rolling my dice
And depart looking for another world
Without any regrets and never looking back
 
The guidelines that you gave to me were a bit unclear
As I become weaker I fall further behind
And I just kept looking at the back of my enemy
 
See that, as well
Had happened in the naked moonlight
It had been taken from my pure but broken heart
Twas a shooting star
  
Please! Show me why
Sheer purity is not enough for you
 
I can't live life this way
Because I can't avoid
Fighting what's in front of me
 
I know that I will fail 'cause
I have never learned
From lessons you once taught
 
This can’t be happening
What should I do?
 
I’m doing nothing but living out my dreams
I can’t move on
Nor be kind
I don't know why.
  
...It's all too much
 
Please! Tell me how
So that I can try to live my life my way
 
I want to make a joke
Of all my problems
And then laugh them off
 
Because I’m stuck in the ground
I feel like I'm doomed these days
  
So I want to have faith
Miracles exist
Please say they do
