I am looking back at my childhood memories,
And they've faded but I still have: a red and white cap placed on my head.
I AM ULTRAMAN, I AM ULTRAMAN, SEVEN!

And one of the good ones stand out to me - I'm eating!
Mother's curry and something else. So put some silver spoons on my eyes.
I AM ULTRAMAN, I AM ULTRAMAN, SEVEN!

I forgot all those things and I live every day
Like there's something right behind me and I think it's chasing me to Hell!

Even if I look back now, (I am looking through an old photo book I just found.)
I still can't go back there. (And I'm doing many dumb things)
Not any more... (While I'm laughing with my good friends)
I AM ULTRAMAN, I AM ULTRAMAN, SEVEN!

I kinda wonder where all of my friends have gone. And did my ex-girl find a good man?
I guess I'll never know but
I AM ULTRAMAN, I AM ULTRAMAN, SEVEN!

I forgot all those things and I live every day
Like there's something right behind me and I think it's chasing me to Hell! 

Courage that you have gi-hi-ven to me's Infinity! Never-ending! (Yeah~)
Seasons that we spent together were that dramatic...

We are looking back at our childhood memories
And we're using 3-D glasses. They were from an old Shonen Jump.
I AM ULTRAMAN, I AM ULTRAMAN, SEVEN!

And all of the good ones have just been erased except one.
Pretend to remember this one so well: we're making L-shapes with our forearms.
I AM ULTRAMAN, I AM ULTRAMAN, SEVEN!

I forgot all those things and I live every day
Like there's something right behind me and I think it's chasing me to Hell!

Even if I look back now, (I cry as I open an old diary; no binding.)
I still can't go back there. (And on the last of the faded pages)
Not any more... (I see the name of my very first love)
I AM ULTRAMAN, I AM ULTRAMAN, SEVEN!

And as a young boy I could simply laugh along! And I could laugh innocently
because back then I said,
“I AM ULTRAMAN, I AM ULTRAMAN, SEVEN!”

I forgot all those things and I live every day
Like there's some thing right behind me and I think it's chasing me to Hell!

As children we slept straight through the R-scenes Infinity! Never-ending! (Yeah~)
Seasons that we spent together were like grafitti...

Courage that you have gi-hi-ven to me's Infinity! Never-ending! (Yeah~)
Seasons that we spent together were that dramatic...

Courage that you have gi-hi-ven to me's Infinity! Never-ending!
