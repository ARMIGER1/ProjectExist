I won't say "I've lost my heart" but it will not beat...
And I fear that when I think again, I will be frozen in the dark moonlight
Warmth that I thought I once had, it was never there.
And my fire was just a mirage; slipped straight through my hands. Lost in quicksand
Even as pressure falls on me and the light has gone from my eyes
I only want one thing (only want one thing) - and it is to fight - once more to see you through one more day.
 
Transparent, I'm dying 
I will be, transparent 
Transparent, Don't wait here 
Just leave me, transparent
 
I'm fading away... farewell forever...
 
I just said that I had been numbed to this Hell (numbed to this Hell)
And somehow I tried to fit in with you. You were one of them: a damned demon
But when I held in my breath, I could only cry (I could only cry)
That's when the thunder cracked and I felt like I was being torn to fragments
Now I choose to keep my feelings, since you forced your way and think for me 
I say that's just fine (I say that's just fine); I just want to live tomorrow and to be with you still
 
Transparent, I have died
Now I am, transparent 
Transparent, turn from me
I'm only, transparent
 
I will be nothing... but a phantom
 
Transparent, Say good-bye 
We are done, transparent 
Transparent, Our last day 
My life's gone, transparent 
Transparent, my heart's stopped 
No more warmth, transparent 
Transparent, cold fingers 
Still love you, transparent
 
I am now nothing... but a memory (transparent)
