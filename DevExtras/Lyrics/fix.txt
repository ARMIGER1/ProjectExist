We were like children back then: so innocent in youth. Just holding hands was enough for me - didn't ask you how you felt.
We thought we understood everything about the world. I realize that I lost sight of how I held on to you.
 
I fell in love with you over and over again. But what I felt since you were gone was a heart-shattering pain.
I now know what I'd done, I'm coming to my se-enses. My hands are cold as if to say "this is how apart we are".
 
I never knew just how sad I could - feel on a night like this. How could this day exist?
And now I cry here. Notice me-e now please... 
 
Now you call my name again and again I hear my name. So my name has been torn to pieces left on the ground.
I love you still so much that I might die from pain. I love you still despite all of the hurt I feel. 
I am so in lo-ove with you. Will always be true. Yeah...
 
Hold my hands to the sky hoping that I can touch the winds which envelop the meaning of your soft voice
In that sky I see a splash of blue but in the center there I see the stain of your red heat
And that air I breathe... And that air I breathe. Oh...
 
Will my name eventually fade away within your mind?
Leave behind an empty void? Is there no other way to stay?
  
Even if a pitch-black night was to come and go. Then I was made blind to everything we shared
I would still shout out loud your name in the dark
I loved you then so much I could have died from pain.  I loved you then despite all of the hurt I felt. 
I need to see your face once more.
 
And I still love you.
